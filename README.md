🚀 **Orbit Simulation** is a Python project that visualizes the gravitational motion of planets around the Sun using **Newton's Law of Gravitation**. This project is powered by **Pygame** for rendering planetary motion and their orbits.

---

## 🌟 Features
✨ Real-time simulation of planetary orbits.  
✨ Includes the Sun, Earth, Mars, Mercury, and Venus.  
✨ Displays the distance of each planet from the Sun.  
✨ Accurate physics with gravitational calculations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**: Programming language.
- **Pygame**: Graphics library for rendering.

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Each celestial body is modeled with properties like:
   - **Mass**: Determines gravitational pull.
   - **Position** and **velocity**: Dictate motion.
   - **Color**: For visual distinction.
2. Gravitational forces are calculated with:
   \[
   F = \frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
   \]
   where:
   - \( F \): Gravitational force.
   - \( G \): Gravitational constant.
   - \( m_1, m_2 \): Masses of two objects.
   - \( r \): Distance between them.
3. The simulation updates positions frame-by-frame for smooth orbital motion.
